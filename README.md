__Hortus Malabaricus__ (English: The Garden of Malabar) is a 12 volume treatise on the medicinal plants of the Malabar coast in Southwestern India. It was compiled and written by a Dutch official of the Dutch East India Company named Hendrick van Rheede, with assistance from his informant and Ezhava herbalist Itty Achudan.[^1]

## Map

The Malabar coast was home to hundreds of plants that had medicinal properties that was only known to the native inhabitants. With a team of around 200 collectors, scientists, and informants, Van Rheede managed to collect and document over 700 specimens of plant life that held great medicinal value.

## Specimen

Each specimine of Malabar's flora was painstakingly drawn, in the case of this coconut tree, and named in Latin, Arabic, Malayalam, and Konkani. Latin was the most widespread version of the Hortus Malabaricus until K.S. Manilal went through the process of translating it to English in 2003, over 300 years after its original publication.
